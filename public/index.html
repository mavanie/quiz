            and hit new repository. Name the repository the name of the program.
            Then select public or private. Public means that anyone can see your
            repository. private means only people with permision can see. Both
            riquire permision to edit.
                Then press create repository. You have now made you repository.

        <h2>Starting a codespace</h2>

            of your codespace. Use the default branch and default region. The
            more cores you use, the less time you have for free. 32 hours with 2 cores.
